Laravel 4 snippets
=================

Emmet style Laravel snippets for __Sublime Text 2__. I used Laravel source to create nice collection of snippets. For longer names there are handy tab-trigger aberrations. So for `Paginator::getCurrentUrl()` you can just use `pagin-gcu` or only `p-gcu` if you are feeling adventurous.

Installation
---------------

**Available at Package Manager! just search for Laravel 4**.

Or you can just git clone this repo into your Packages folder.

    git clone https://github.com/bliker/laravel4-snippets.git

Building
-----------
You can build the snippets yourself by checking out the develop branch and running

    php Start.php
